# DrumBottles
This is a project for IDMT 2019 Cruft named **DrumBottles**. The idea is to transform waste bottle into kick drum and play my own LOFI music. This project is implemented using [Processing 3.5.3](https://processing.org/download/) & [Arduino 1.8.10](https://www.arduino.cc/). 

Hardware part includes:

* arduino uno 
* breadboard
* force sensors
* strip boards and wires

DrumBottles enables you to play drums with melody. Below is the start page of the software. After pressing the start button, you can listen to a melody loop and also see it on screen.

Knocking the bottles can make different kinds of kick-drum sound. The corresponding bottle will stand up as a clue that there can be a specific drum sound. So if you are a novice you can knock the bottle when you see it raises on screen, or just knock whenever you like if you are music expert.

> They are bottles of my favorite coconut water. :yum:
