# DrumBottles
This is a project for IDMT 2019 Cruft named **DrumBottles**. The idea is to transform waste bottle into kick drum and play my own LOFI music. This project is implemented using [Processing 3.5.3](https://processing.org/download/) & [Arduino 1.8.10](https://www.arduino.cc/). Hardware part includes arduino uno, breadboard, force sensors, strip boards and wires. 

DrumBottles enables you to play drums with melody. Below is the start page of the software. After pressing the start button, you can listen to a melody loop and also see it on screen. Knocking the bottles can make different kinds of kick-drum sound. The corresponding bottle will stand up as a clue that there can be a specific drum sound. So if you are a novice you can knock the bottle when you see it raises on screen, or just knock whenever you like if you are music expert.

They are bottles of my favorite coconut water.
